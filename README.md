# PasswordGenerator
It takes basic information about you(eg. birthdate, phone number, anything you like), and adds a random piece of information to your name to create a password. It also replaces letters with, and adds, symbols to make it a strong password. Also you can choose to create any number of passwords you like, so you have more options to choose from.
